# Featured Project: VFW Inventory System

We don't just talk about modernization; we build it. We recently developed a **Equipment Loan Closet Inventory System** for a local VFW post.

**The Problem:** The post was managing thousands of dollars of equipment using paper logbooks, leading to lost items and difficult tracking.

**Our Solution:** We built a secure, mobile-first web application deployed on Google Cloud.

### Key Features
* **Mobile-Ready Dashboard:** Volunteers can check items in and out directly from their smartphones in the storage shed.
* **Real-Time Tracking:** Instantly see what is "Available" vs "On Loan."
* **Overdue Alerts:** The system automatically flags items past their return date in red.
* **Privacy First:** Secure login and database protection for veteran data.

### System Preview

**1. The Commander's Dashboard**
*A high-level view of all assets, featuring a dark mode for low-light environments and quick action buttons.*

**2. Mobile Checkout**
